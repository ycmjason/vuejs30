# Vue.js 30 \[WIP\]

A Vue.js version of [Javascript 30](https://github.com/wesbos/JavaScript30). Similar to [Dave Follett's version](https://github.com/davefollett/JavaScript30) but the questions are rewritten in a more Vue-ish way.

## Credits
- Credits to @wesbos for introducing Javascript 30
- Credits to @davefollett as well for tossing the idea of creating a Vue version of Javascript 30
